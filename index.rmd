Practical Machine Learning 
========================================================

A key early component of any machine learning project involves managing and understanding the data.


## Getting started

## Loading data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
